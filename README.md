## Description

In this project, I've provided some examples of what I learned about the backtrader python package by following along with [Part Time Larry's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkH1TQl7qo "Algorithmic Trading with Python and Backtrader") "Algorithmic Trading with Python and Backtrader" videos on youtube. The current project has two datasets (Oracle stock and S&P 500) and two trading strategies (Golden Cross and Buy & Hold for 5 days).

## How To Use

An example of how to run this is: `python trader.py golden_cross SPY 5000 20`. This runs the backtest using the golden_cross strategy using S&P500 data starting with $5k and order sizes of 20 stocks.

The five arguments:

### `strategy`,

The type of strategy you want to backtest. Currently only `golden_cross` and `buy_hold5days` are accepted.

### `ticker`,

The stock ticker used to test your strategy on. Currently only `ORCL` and `SPY` are accepted.

### `starting_cash`,

The amount of cash you want to start your backtest with.

### `order_size`,

The number of stocks you wish to execute an order with.

## Built With

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Backtrader

## Future Updates

- Get ticker and historical price data programmatically
- Allow for input of date range arguments
- Create more sophisticated buy options for placed orders
