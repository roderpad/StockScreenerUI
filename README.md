## Description

In this project, I've created a stock screener web application using FastAPI (a new Python framework built on Starlette) by following along with [Part Time Larry's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GorMC2lPpk "FastAPI Python Tutorial - Building a Stock Screener with FastAPI") "FastAPI Python Tutorial - Building a Stock Screener with FastAPI" videos on youtube. The project utilizes many of the FastAPI features including pydantic models, dependency injection, background/async tasks, and SQLAlchemy integration. API endpoint testing was done using Insomnia API client. 

### `UI Design`
The frontend UI design is done using SemanticUI and Jinja2 templates, including CSS and JavaScript from the CDN.

### `Database Design`
The database design is done using SQLAlchemy models. The database has one table 'stocks.db' that holds stock data retrieved programmatically as a background task to prevent UI hang from yahoo finance (yfinance package).

## How To Use

An example of how to run this is: `python trader.py golden_cross SPY 5000 20`. This runs the backtest using the golden_cross strategy using S&P500 data starting with $5k and order sizes of 20 stocks.

The five arguments:

### `strategy`,

The type of strategy you want to backtest. Currently only `golden_cross` and `buy_hold5days` are accepted.

### `ticker`,

The stock ticker used to test your strategy on. Currently only `ORCL` and `SPY` are accepted.

### `starting_cash`,

The amount of cash you want to start your backtest with.

### `order_size`,

The number of stocks you wish to execute an order with.

## Built With

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Backtrader

## Future Updates

- Get ticker and historical price data programmatically
- Allow for input of date range arguments
- Create more sophisticated buy options for placed orders
